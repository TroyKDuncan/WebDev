# Deliberate Practice

- at first with something new, you learn rapidly but start to plateau
- you need these to continue learning:
  1. Specific Goals
     - have big goals that you are working toward (get a job, learn full-stack, get out of debt)
     - break down larger goals into smaller ones that are attainable in the short term (practice promises in React)
     - it's about putting a bunch of baby steps together to reach a long-term goal
  2. Intense Focus
     - you seldom imrove much without giving the task your full attention
  3. Immediate Feedback
     - you have to know whether you are doing something right and, if not, what you're doing wrong
  4. Discomfort at the edge of your abilities
     - try to do and learn something that you couldn't do before
     - generally, the solution isn't going to be "try harder", but "try differently"
- it's not supposed to be fun
- you need to put deliberate time and focus into things
